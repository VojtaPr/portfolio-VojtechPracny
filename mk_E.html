                <p>MK(media club) Slovanka is a team that was founded in 2023 to involve students of my old elementary and middle school ZÅ  Na Slovance + Erasmus students in creating social networks for that school.
                The team consists of about 25 members and 2 teachers.<BR><BR> Before MK Slovanka, the school had (and still has) a website, but we wanted to contribute more to our school 
                and promote it in this way by creating posts, photos and videos for events of the school. I had the position of chief technician and was one of the photographers, YouTube administrators and video makers in this team.
                <BR><BR>I provided technical support for my school's events.
                <BR>For example, I was a technician and a photographer at an event for the 50th anniversary of the schools founding.
                <BR>I also made a few pages for the school magazine in the past.
