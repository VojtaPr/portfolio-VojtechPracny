            <p>At SSPŠ I first attended the Techdays event, then various weekly teaching programs in the summer of 2024 and tutoring in mathematics and Czech for the High school entrance exams the same year.
            In summer I participated in the summer school of web development, game development and the summer school of 3D printing and modeling.<BR><BR> In game development I created a game about a turtle crossing the road and
            in 3D printing and modeling I printed (then colored at home) the Umbrella Corporation logo from the RE series and a render of a rainy street in Blender (for which my co-participant and I won 2nd or 3rd place, I don't remember very well now, at that summer school).
            The web development summer school helped me get off to a good start in creating this website.
