                <p> I've worked on three games so far (of which I've finished one). The first was a game in Python, in which you play in the world of Resident evil 8.
                    The game is in text form and has a set story - so far, i've only finished the function of switching through the menu at the beginning of the game + the introduction to the plot.<BR><BR> The second is a game made in Unreal Engine 5 in VR using blueprints.
                    Originally I wanted to create my own part of the game RE8 for VR (the game does not have PCVR support, only for PSVR), and I managed to set up walking, import gun models + I got it running with partial physics
                    and original audio. But unfortunately, the project stopped working due to my old computer crashing a lot. However, I managed to upload the gameplay, so you can watch it in the video below.
                    <BR><BR> I kinda managed to finish the last third game.<BR> It's about a turtle that crosses a road with moving cars on it, to get to a protected nature sanctuary.
                    <BR> The game has a menu, a start and an end, you can die there and you can restart and win, but it's lengthy and quite boring due to the lack of cars, models, textures, animations, sound and bonuses.
                    <BR> I programmed the game in C# at the summer programming school at the SSPÅ .
