                <p> My first PC had a CPU: Intel Core i5-3470, GPU: GTX 1050 Ti, ASUS H61M-K, 8Gb DDR3 RAM,
                    EVOLVEO 12L1BL air cooling, Intel LGA1155/1156 oem air cooling on the CPU and an unidetifiable, dangerously opened(it was missing a wall of the casing) PSU, all inside of an old version of the EVOLVEO T3 case.
                    <BR>It was my first computer, which my parents bought from some guy who built it. I've cleaned it a few times and also taken it apart.
                    <BR><BR>I recently managed to save up for a new computer after 3-4 years, which is much better and hopefully won't fall apart like my old one. I've been thinking about a new PC for 3 years,
                    so I already know a lot about components and building computers.
                    <BR><BR>I built the new computer myself. It has the CPU: 7 7800X3D, GPU: RTX 4080 SUPER, Cooler Master MasterLiquid 360L, MSI B650 GAMING PLUS WIFI, G.Skill Trident Z5 Neo RGB 32 GB(2x 16GB),
                    Kingston KC3000 2.048 TB M.2-2280, MSI MAG A850GL PCIE5 850 W 80+ Gold, <BR>inside the Phanteks NV5 ATX Mid Tower Case with 4 fans ARCTIC P12 PST A-RGB.
                  
                    <BR><BR> You can see the full PC build edited in videos below.
